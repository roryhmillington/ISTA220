Chapter 5


1.	What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work?

	Combines any arithmetic operator with the assignment operator.

2.	List all the compound assignment operators.

	*=, /=, %=, +=, -=.

3. 	List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50.

	variable = variable + 5; ,variable += 5; variable = variable - 50, variable -= 50;

4.	How long does a while loop run?

	Until the statement is evaluated false.	

5.	What happens if you donâ€™t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?

         The loop will continue to run.        	

6.     How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of them? What happens if you omit all of them?

        3 parts, you omit any of the 3 parts, have a strangely spelled while loop.

7.     How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?

        Use the do statement so the Boolean is evaluated after the iteration. 

8.    What does the break statement do?

        It allows you to jump out of the body of an iteration statement.

9.     What does the continue statement do?

        The continue statement causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediately (after reevaluating the Boolean expression).
